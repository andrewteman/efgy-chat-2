Winter Break

Wednesday, December 3, 2025 ‚Äì Tuesday, February 10, 2026
You can use Winter Break in a lot of different ways. It could be a time for you to rest, to see friends & family, to work, and/or
to keep traveling on your own time! EF covers your flight to and from your home city to return home for the break. If you have
other plans, make sure to discuss these in advance with your Advisor so they can outline your options and flight policies.

An additional note for those spending their second semester in Europe: As a US passport holder, we recommend avoiding travel to
the Schengen Region during winter break. Your cumulative time in Europe will be within the visa-free limit but with little margin.
Please use the visa calculator here [https://www.visa-calculator.com/]to confirm.

IMMERSION SEMESTER

Option 1: Language Study

Days 85-89: Wednesday, February 11 ‚Äì Sunday, February 15
Welcome to your new home!
Fly from your home to your selected EF Language Campus location. Arrive on Thursday, February 12 and enjoy a Welcome Dinner
alongside your cohort. Spend the weekend settling into your new home with guided exploration and orientation sessions designed to
get you acquainted with your peers and new home for the semester.

Days 90-157: Monday, February 16 ‚Äì Friday, April 24
Immersion at the EF Language Campus
During this semester, you‚Äôll be living more independently, immersing yourself in local culture, and learning the language. On your
first morning of class, you‚Äôll make your way independently to the local EF language school. Depending on where you are, this could
mean taking a subway, a bus, walking, or likely a combination. Using local transportation on your own to commute is a big part of
building the independence you‚Äôll get out of this experience.

When you arrive at the EF school, you‚Äôll get a tour of the campus and take a language test to determine what section you‚Äôll be in.
There will be other students from your cohort there, other EF Gap students from other programs, and EF students from around the
world who have come to this city to take language classes. As you go through 10 weeks of language, you‚Äôll have the chance to make
new friends from all over the world!

The first week will usually be the most challenging ‚Äì you are getting to learn a new city, traveling around independently, and
taking classes in a foreign language. And unlike what you may have done in high school, these classes will be fully in the local
language with no English spoken. This is because EF is an experiential learning company, and we believe in the power of learning
by immersion. Leaning in and doing your best this first week will set you up for success for the remainder of your time in this
semester, and will go a long way towards improving your language skills and confidence. You‚Äôll have 3-4 hours of class per day,
and the rest of the day is up to you to decide how you want to experience living in this new city. Learn more about EF‚Äôs approach
to language learning through this video¬†here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOqBIPAyvnc].¬†

You will be supported by on-the-ground staff who will support your cohort of EF Gap students. They will arrange regular meetings
and check-ins with your group to keep you on track with your goals.

Your EF school will also have an activities calendar where you can see events that you can sign up for. Some will be free, some
will be fairly cheap like a local cooking class or sports game, and others will be more expensive as they can include full weekend
trips. Whatever you choose to do, it‚Äôs a great way to make friends and get to know the area.

During your last week of your time at the EF Language Campus, you will have a graduation ceremony and celebrate your success! Note
that you must attend at least 80% of your classes in order to successfully receive your graduation certificate.

Days 158-161: Saturday, April 25 ‚Äì Tuesday, April 28
Wrap-Up
Spend your last few days with your fellow EF Gap students reflecting on all that you‚Äôve achieved throughout your year. You will
have guided sessions and workshops focused on processing all that you‚Äôve learned and how to take these learnings into your next
steps. Then, you'll close out the year with a Farwell Dinner alongside your cohort before you fly home on April 28.

Option 2: Internship

Days 85-89: Wednesday, February 11 ‚Äì Sunday, February 15
Welcome to your new home!
Fly from your home to Stockholm, Sweden. Arrive on Thursday, February 12 and enjoy a Welcome Dinner alongside your cohort. Spend
the weekend settling into your new home with guided exploration and orientation sessions designed to get you acquainted with your
peers and new home for the semester.

Days 90-157: Monday, February 16 ‚Äì Friday, April 24
Internship in Stockholm
For 10 weeks, you will be living in Stockholm and working at your internship. This is the most independent module of your program.
At this point, you are living in an apartment, cooking your own meals, and commuting to and from your internship on all weekdays.
You have been building the skills throughout your Gap experience to be able to successfully live and work in a new country!

You will typically be working approximately 9am to 5pm Monday through Friday at your internship in Stockholm. Each company will
have slightly different expectations around your timing, so make sure to understand their expectations and follow them throughout
your time in Stockholm.

You are expected to be at work every day. The weekends are your time to do any personal travel you may want to do in the region.
Your weeknights are time for you to rest, explore, or decompress with friends.

Throughout your time in Stockholm, you will have regular opportunities for professional development experiences.

Days 158-161: Saturday, April 25 ‚Äì Tuesday, April 28
Wrap-Up
Spend your last few days with your fellow EF Gap students reflecting on all that you‚Äôve achieved throughout your year. You will
have guided sessions and workshops focused on processing all that you‚Äôve learned and how to take these learnings into your next
steps. Then, you'll close out the year with a Farwell Dinner alongside your cohort before you fly home on April 28.


PREPARING TO TRAVEL

Packing
We recommend bringing one checked bag and a personal item, like as a backpack. Packing two weeks‚Äô worth of essentials is ideal, as
laundry services will be available either at the hotel for a fee or at a local laundromat. You will be expected to carry your
luggage throughout the program, and some accommodations may not have elevators, so pack light! With a variety of activities and
climates ahead, packing according to the itinerary is essential. Additionally, ‚Äúathleisure‚Äù is not super common in Europe, so we
suggest assembling a capsule wardrobe. You may also visit sites like cathedrals that require modest clothing (knees and shoulders
covered). In Thailand, the weight limit for most airlines is 20 KGS / 44 LBS. Keep this in mind while packing, as this is notably
different than the typical 50 LB limit for the majority of other flights.¬†

Budgeting
Whatever your personal spending habits are, it‚Äôs important to anticipate your expenses and budget accordingly so that you can
travel care-free with more time to enjoy participating in your program. While many meals and activities are included during your
EF Gap program, we want to help you build a realistic budget for additional expenses so that you can fully enjoy trying the local
cuisine, participating in activities in your free time, and, of course, shopping for souvenirs to bring back home.

Pre-departure checklist
This checklist will help you keep track of all the different tasks you need to complete prior to departing on your EF Gap program.

BUDGETING GUIDE

Money management

Overview¬†

We don‚Äôt recommend traveling with large sums of cash. You may want to convert a small amount of money to the currency of your
first destination. From there, you‚Äôll be able to access local currency by using your debit card to withdraw cash from an ATM.¬†¬†

Be sure to check with your bank ahead of time and, if necessary, provide a travel notice so they don‚Äôt block the card for
suspected fraud. Also ask them about any foreign transaction fees that might apply, as these can add up quickly. We recommend
bringing a back-up credit card in case your primary card is lost or stolen.¬†

Semester 1: Europe (various currencies)¬†

Plan to budget $200-300 per week while you are traveling through Europe. Since you are visiting some of Europe‚Äôs most popular
cities, the cost of living is high (especially in Zurich!). Be mindful of how much you are spending, since it‚Äôs the first part of
your program. Note that currencies vary across countries you will be visiting: ¬†

 * England‚Äôs currency is the Great British pound¬†

 * France, Italy, and Germany's currency is the euro¬†

 * Switzerland‚Äôs currency is the Swiss franc¬†

 * The Czech Republic's currency is the koruna¬†

Semester 1: Australia (Australian dollar)¬†

Plan to budget around¬†$70 per day¬†for living expenses during your time in Australia. Australians are some the wealthiest people in
the world, so the cost of living can be quite high. In addition to meals, there are also optional activities you might choose to
do during your free time; depending on the activity, those can cost upwards of $100 in Australia.¬†

Semester 1: Thailand¬†(Thai baht)¬†

Plan to budget around¬†$20-$25 per day¬†for living expenses during your time in Thailand. Compared to places like the US or
Australia, Thailand is an extremely affordable country.¬†

Semester 2: Language or Internship¬†

Plan to budget $200-$400 per week (11 weeks total). However, your budget will highly depend on the cost of living in your
particular city. During second semester, you will be responsible for your own meals. You may also want to set additional money
aside for personal travel; many students decide to travel in the region independently on holidays or weekends. ¬†

Expenses

Meals¬†

First semester, all breakfasts and some lunches or dinners will be provided on program. Second semester, you are responsible for
all meals, aside from some meals at orientation, wrap-up, and group meals. ¬†

Transportation¬†

Many of the cities you will be in are very walkable and/or accessible with low-cost public transport. If you opt for private
transportation like Ubers or taxis, this will add to your expenses.¬†

Extras¬†

We recommend budgeting¬†up to $50 a week for extra costs.¬†This could mean putting money aside for things like:¬†

‚Äì Additional checked bag airline fee¬†
‚Äì Additional items of clothing¬†
‚Äì Emergencies¬†
‚Äì Extra toiletries¬†
‚Äì Souvenirs¬†
‚Äì Laundry¬†
‚Äì Optional Excursions:¬†Your Tour Director may find opportunities for additional excursions and activities; typically, these
experiences can cost anywhere from $20-$100+, and there may be one or two opportunities like this each week.¬†

PACKING TIPS

BE PREPARED FOR BAGGAGE ACCOUNTABILITY

You will be on the move constantly, which means you will be responsible for carrying the weight of your luggage‚Äìand remember,
elevators are not common in many foreign countries. Make this easy on yourself and don‚Äôt pack more than you need.

PACKING TIPS

BE AWARE OF BAGGAGE ALLOWANCES

Bag allowances for checked bags, carry-on, and personal items vary by airline and route. Visit your airline's website to
understand their policy. It is important you stick to this limit, as your luggage will need to fit on the bus with the rest of
your cohort‚Äôs luggage. Airlines will directly charge you excess weight or additional luggage.

PACKING TIPS

CONSIDER COST OF OVERSIZED BAGS

Checked luggage sizes are generally no more than 29" in height and 45lb in weight; carry-on sizes vary by airline, so you will
want to check once you know your flight information. Please know that if your bag exceeds the weight limit, you will be
responsible for the extra cost per airline.

PACKING TIPS

REMEMBER TO RE-PACK

We suggest packing your bag once and then re-packing it, taking out a few things the second time; the pack and re-pack method will
let you do a trial run, so that you really, truly take only what you need. Trust us, there will be an opportunity to make
purchases while you travel!

PACKING TIPS

REMOVE ITEMS YOU DO NOT NEED

You do not need to bring sheets or bath towels for second semester; these will be provided. Additionally, you can buy an
inexpensive beach towel once you arrive in any beach destination.

PACKING TIPS

VERSATILITY IS KEY

Pack basics, neutral colors, and layers so you can easily mix and match. Pack items that can be dressed up or dressed down so you
can use them for multiple locations.

PACKING TIPS

SNACK LIGHT

Bring a few granola bars or snacks for your initial travels, but no need to pack more food. A large part of your experience while
abroad is immersing yourself in the culture‚Äîthis includes the food you eat. Who knows, you may find a new favorite food!

PACKING TIPS

TRAVEL LIGHT

We cannot stress enough the importance of packing light: it is vital that you bring no more than two bags‚Äìthe standard is one
checked bag and one personal item. Leave some extra room in your suitcase for souvenirs.

PACKING TIPS

BRING A FIRST AID KIT

You don't need much, but it's really helpful to bring a few things like Band-Aids and antibiotic cream. Additionally, generic
over-the-counter medicines to address common ailments are very helpful (e.g. upset stomach, motion sickness, headaches, cough
drops, etc.).

PACKING TIPS

TRAVEL TAGS ARE YOUR BAG‚ÄôS BEST FRIEND

Don‚Äôt forget to put a luggage tag on your bags so you can easily identify them! We also advise taking a photo of your bags before
you depart in the event they get lost or delayed.




CULTURAL IMMERSION

This section is your go-to guide for insights and tips about the incredible destinations you'll explore during your program.
Gaining an understanding of each place‚Äîits culture, customs, and everyday life‚Äîwill help you engage more meaningfully and navigate
new experiences with confidence. Embracing cultural norms and traditions fosters deeper connections with locals, enriches personal
growth, and makes your journey even more rewarding. Think of this as just the beginning‚Äîlet your curiosity lead the way as you
dive into your own research and discoveries!¬†

LOCATIONS

England

The basics¬†

England is part of the United Kingdom along with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. They are united under the same monarch and
government, though each has their own parliaments. The monarchy holds a deep cultural and historical significance in England,
symbolizing continuity and national identity, with many people expressing great respect for the institution, regardless of their
personal views on its role in modern society. Be mindful not to call the whole of the UK, ‚ÄúEngland,‚Äù especially not when meeting
Scots, Welsh, or Northern Irish, as they‚Äôll likely be offended. Study up a bit on the geography before arriving!¬†

Formed by the union of small Celtic and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the medieval period, England is comprised of several distinct
regions. Many English people identify with the region where they‚Äôre from‚Äîfor example, Yorkshire, the West Country, or the
Midlands. After World War II, England became highly urbanized.¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†

The English are known for being punctual so be mindful of being on time for scheduled activities, meals and meet-up times
communicated by your Tour Director. You won‚Äôt want to miss ‚Äúafternoon tea‚Äù which is an essential part of English culture. It's
common to have afternoon tea around 3:00-4:00pm accompanied by light snacks like sandwiches, scones with jam, and cake.¬†
¬†
While waiting in line for different experiences or even the bathroom, mind the queue. It's considered rude to cut in front of
someone who is waiting in line. You never know who you‚Äôll meet in line, especially in London which is a melting pot of people from
across the globe. You‚Äôll hear lots of languages being spoken and be exposed to different cuisines.¬†¬†

Learn a few common words and phrases. Even though they speak English, you‚Äôll notice new vocabulary, such as:¬†

 * Quid: a one-pound coin¬†

 * Knackered: exhausted¬†

 * Cheers: thanks!¬†

 * It‚Äôs proper good!: something is really great¬†¬†

 * The loo: the bathroom¬†¬†

If you fancy a pint, England has a rich pub culture, with many socializing regularly in local pubs. It's common to drink beer,
cider, or spirits. In restaurants, a service charge (usually 10-15%) may already be included in the bill, but if it's not, tipping
around 10% is customary. While out and about be mindful that cars drive on the other side of the road (compared to how we drive in
the US). Always look both ways before crossing the street!¬†
¬†
While you‚Äôll see a lot of the city, don‚Äôt expect to see the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace! Don‚Äôt be caught as a tourist mixing
up Tower Bridge and London Bridge: London Bridge refers to several bridges built over the Thames, while Tower Bridge is the
current bridge between the City of London and Southwark in Central London.¬†

France

The basics¬†

Paris, France‚Äôs capital, is a major metropolitan area and a bustling center of fashion, cuisine, art, and architecture. Between
the busy cafes, countless art museums, and quaint streets, Paris offers an experience of French culture like no other.¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†

While in Paris, you will rely heavily on public transit so learn the metro or local transit system. It can be complicated at
first, but once you get the hang of it, you‚Äôll have access to the whole city. Note that it‚Äôs not uncommon for strikes to impact
your commute. Due to the size and large population of the city, anticipate longer than average commutes from your accommodation to
the city center. As you navigate, don‚Äôt dawdle or walk slowly. If you‚Äôre lost, pop into a shop or a nearby caf√© and reorient
yourself. In Europe, try to always walk with a purpose to avoid unwanted attention or pickpockets.¬†

No matter the commute, it‚Äôs always worth it as the food and wine, pivotal to the French people, will make this city a favorite on
your foodie list. Some classic dishes include boeuf bourguignon and coq au vin. Breakfasts are often small and sweet‚Äìfor example,
something like bread and jam. It is uncommon to have eggs, sausages, bacon, and other typical American breakfasts in Paris.¬†

When entering a shop or browsing at an outdoor market, it is customary to greet the shopkeeper or business owner; A simple
‚ÄúBonjour/Hello‚Äù during the day or ‚ÄúBonsoir/Good evening‚Äù at night will go a long way! Parisians value those who try to speak
French, so brush up on some common words and phrases:¬†¬†

 * Bonjour: Hello, Good morning¬†

 * Au revoir: Goodbye¬†

 * Oui: Yes¬†

 * Merci beaucoup: Thank you very much¬†

 * Je m‚Äôappelle: My name is‚Ä¶¬†

 * Comment allez-vous?: How are you doing?¬†

 * Combien √ßa co√ªte?: How much is this?¬†

French people, particularly Parisians, may have a different communication style than Americans. They communicate clearly and
directly, without much cushioning or sugar-coating, which can be shocking ‚Äì don't take it personally!¬†¬†

Anticipate less emphasis on personal space. French people often greet one another with a kiss on the cheek and a hug (even
strangers!). Similarly, they have a much smaller expectation of (or regard for) personal space. Plus, French people love to
observe. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you catch people lounging at caf√©s (or in other locations) staring at you every now and then; this
is common and isn‚Äôt considered to be rude in French culture.¬†

Unfortunately, anti-immigrant and anti-Black racism in France is not uncommon. Students of color, particularly Black students, may
encounter verbal harassment or more attention from police.¬†

Overall, enjoy this romantic city and all the croissants and history it boasts!¬†¬†

Switzerland

The basics¬†¬†¬†

Switzerland, a landlocked country in Central Europe, is renowned for its stunning alpine landscapes, political neutrality, and
high quality of life. It is home to breathtaking mountains, picturesque lakes, and charming cities like Zurich, Geneva, and Bern.
Switzerland is famous for its precision engineering, luxury watches, and world-class banking system. The country has four official
languages‚ÄîGerman, French, Italian, and Romansh‚Äîreflecting its diverse cultural heritage. Since 1815, following the Napoleonic
Wars, Switzerland has been granted neutrality, meaning they avoid participation in wars between other states Known for its
commitment to diplomacy, it hosts numerous international organizations, including the United Nations and the Red Cross. Swiss
traditions such as cheese fondue, chocolate-making, and yodeling contribute to its unique cultural identity, making it a
fascinating blend of tradition and modernity.¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†¬†

Due to its centralized location, Swiss culture is largely an accumulation of many European cultures. Approximately 65% of Swiss
people consider themselves Swiss German, while 18% consider themselves of French ethnic descent and another 10% as Italian
descent.¬†¬†¬†

The public transportation and train system in Switzerland is fantastic (albeit, pricey). If you find yourself with a free day or
two in the city, head over to the Zurich HB for a scenic train ride to nearby hotspots, like Lucerne or Engelberg. Switzerland
makes travel easy through the Swiss Rail Pass.¬†¬†¬†

As you explore different regions, you'll notice how specific characteristics sharply define the country. For example, in the east,
you‚Äôll find many tight-knit, German-speaking, mountain communities. In the west, you may find more French speakers. As a rule of
thumb, greet everyone you meet. This includes shop keepers, hotel staff, and even the hikers you may pass by. This is customary
and polite etiquette in Switzerland.¬†¬†¬†

As you may suspect, Swiss food is influenced by German, French, and Italian cuisine. A few favorite dishes include R√∂sti (a hot
cake made of potatoes and fried in butter), cheese fondue, and, of course, Swiss chocolate!¬†

The Swiss franc is used as currency and 1 Swiss Franc is equivalent to a little over 1 USD. Switzerland is notoriously known for
being expensive in comparison to the US. For example, at a fast-food restaurant like McDonalds, expect to pay anywhere from 12-20
CHF.¬†¬†

Tipping in Switzerland is generally not mandatory but appreciated. A tip of 5-10% is common in restaurants if service is good.
However, service charges are often included in the bill, so tipping is discretionary. In cafes and bars, rounding up the bill or
leaving small change is sufficient.¬†¬†

Lastly, get ready to rock your wardrobe! Swiss people value appearance and style. You will rarely see them wearing ripped jeans or
shabby clothing!¬†¬†

Italy

The basics¬†

Italy, a peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea, is home to the epicenter of the of the Roman Empire, a major hub of Catholicism, and
the birthplace of the Renaissance. The country is known for its incredible food and history around every corner.¬†¬†¬†

The Catholic Church‚Äôs statistics suggest that 96% of Italians were baptized as Catholic, so that alone speaks to the dominance of
Catholic traditions. Whether or not you‚Äôre Catholic, you will be welcomed into the country with open arms, but it‚Äôs important to
respect the traditions, particularly when visiting religious site, such as the many towering cathedrals or Vatican City.¬†¬†¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†

Learn common words and phrases:¬†¬†¬†

 * Ciao, ragazzi = Hey guys!¬†¬†¬†

 * Buongiorno = Good morning¬†¬†

 * Buonasera = Good evening¬†¬†

 * Lei parla inglese = Do you speak English?¬†¬†

 * Come va = How are you?¬†¬†

 * Bene, grazie = Good, thank you¬†¬†

Be prepared for hugs and kisses when greeting others. It‚Äôs common to give air kisses on both cheeks when greeting others; this is
called il bacetto.¬†¬†

Don‚Äôt spend too much time in touristy areas! Visit once, then explore the less traveled areas.¬†¬†¬†

In big cities like Rome, popular areas can be very touristy. It‚Äôs not uncommon for Americans to get pick-pocketed, so be sure to
keep your important documents or electronics close (we suggest a cross body or a fanny pack!). Make sure to keep your phone zipped
away, not in the pocket of pants or jacket.¬†

The Czech Republic

The basics ¬†

The Czech Republic, located in the heart of Central Europe, is a country known for its rich history, charming architecture, and
vibrant culture. Bordered by Germany, Austria, Slovakia, and Poland, it serves as a crossroads between Eastern and Western Europe.
Its capital, Prague, is often called the "City of a Hundred Spires" and is renowned for its stunning medieval buildings and lively
atmosphere. The Czech Republic boasts a well-preserved heritage, from Gothic castles and Baroque towns to its famous tradition of
brewing some of the world's finest beers. Today, it is a modern and dynamic country, blending its deep historical roots with a
strong economy and a thriving arts and cultural scene.¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect ¬†

Czechs are generally reserved and value privacy. When meeting someone for the first time, it is best to avoid overly personal
questions. Exhibiting modesty and politeness will help foster positive interactions. ¬†

Learn a few common words and phrases:¬†

 * Dobr√Ω den = Good day¬†

 * Dƒõkuji = Thank you¬†

 * Mluv√≠te anglicky? =¬†Do you speak English?¬†

Czechs place great importance on proper greetings, typically involving a firm handshake, direct eye contact, and greeting everyone
upon entering a room. Punctuality is highly valued, both in social and professional settings. Arriving late without notice is
viewed as disrespectful. ¬†

To arrive on time, be aware of decorum on public transport as it‚Äôs a common and reliable means of getting around. It is expected
that passengers give up their seats to the elderly or those with disabilities. ¬†

When dining, wait for the host to say ‚ÄúDobrou chu≈•‚Äù (enjoy your meal) before beginning to eat. It is customary to say ‚ÄúNa zdrav√≠‚Äù
(cheers) when toasting during meals. While tipping is not obligatory, rounding up the bill or leaving a 10% tip for good service
is appreciated in restaurants.¬†

Lastly, respect for tradition is deeply ingrained in Czech society, with significant attention paid to holidays such as Easter and
Christmas.¬†

Australia

The basics¬†

Australia is a land like no other ‚Äì full of breathtaking natural wonders, vibrant cities, and rich cultural heritage. Home to
approximately 26 million people, it has deep Indigenous roots, with Aboriginal communities thriving for over 50,000 years before
British colonization in 1788.¬†

Today, Australia is a diverse, democratic nation known for its stunning landscapes, from the Great Barrier Reef to the red sands
of Uluru. Sydney, its largest city, boasts the iconic Opera House, Harbor Bridge, and lively neighborhoods like Potts Point and
Newtown. With a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere, Australia offers an unforgettable experience for travelers.¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†

Australians are friendly and laid-back but value directness and humility. Conversations often include sarcasm, so don‚Äôt be
surprised by casual teasing‚Äîit‚Äôs usually a sign of friendliness.¬†¬†

Australia is known to be an expensive destination, especially in cities like Sydney and Melbourne. Tipping isn‚Äôt expected, as
wages are higher than in the U.S., though rounding up the bill or leaving 10% for great service is appreciated. When dining out
with friends, it‚Äôs common to split the bill rather than one person paying for all. Australians also take beach safety
seriously‚Äîalways swim between the red and yellow flags, as currents can be strong.¬†

Respect for Indigenous culture is important, so be mindful when discussing Aboriginal history or visiting sacred sites like Uluru.
Australians also have a more relaxed attitude toward swearing, which is common even in casual workplaces. Public transport is
efficient in major cities, but you‚Äôll need a contactless card like Opal or Myki to use trains, buses, and ferries. If you're
polite and open-minded, you'll feel right at home in Australia!¬†

Thailand

The basics¬†¬†

Known as the ‚ÄúLand of a Thousand Smiles,‚Äù Thailand is a truly special place to visit. Thailand lies between Cambodia, Myanmar, and
Laos, with the Gulf of Thailand to its south. Its varied landscapes are extremely diverse; you‚Äôll find everything from forested
mountains and dry plateaus in the north to river plains, sandy beaches, and dozens of tropical islands in the south.¬†¬†¬†

Thailand is a constitutional monarchy with a rich political history. The current king Maha Vajiralongkorn is the son of the third
longest reigning monarch in history and many Thai people hold significant reverence for the royal family and its symbols. Thailand
is home to thousands of stunning temples (wats) that showcase the nation‚Äôs rich spiritual traditions, so prepare for many temple
visits along your travels.¬†¬†

The rainy, or ‚Äúmonsoon,‚Äù season roughly runs from May until November, with the heaviest rains coming in October and November. The
temperatures across the country hit their highs between March and April, with an average range of 85-95 degrees Fahrenheit in
those months, so we recommend bringing quick-dry and light clothing for comfort.¬†¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†

Thailand is a welcoming country with deep cultural traditions that visitors should respect. The royal family is highly revered,
and any criticism is both offensive and illegal. Instead of handshakes, Thais often greet with a wai (palms pressed together with
a slight bow), though tourists aren‚Äôt expected to initiate it.¬†¬†

Modesty is important, especially when visiting temples‚Äîshoulders and knees should be covered. While casual wear is fine at
beaches, it‚Äôs best to dress more conservatively in cities. Always remove your shoes before entering temples or homes. Showing
respect and adapting to local customs will ensure a positive experience in Thailand.¬†

Street food is a huge part of Thai cuisine, offering delicious and affordable options like pad thai, mango sticky rice, and
grilled satay. Tipping is not customary in Thailand, but small gratuities for great service can be very much appreciated.¬†¬†¬†

Spain

The basics¬†

Spain‚Äôs history is a mix of ancient Roman, Moorish, and global influences, shaping its vibrant culture today. In 1492, Spain‚Äôs
Catholic Monarchs finished the Reconquista, and Columbus set sail to the Americas, marking the start of Spain‚Äôs global empire.
This rich past is still alive in the country‚Äôs art, architecture, and traditions like flamenco and bullfighting. Today, Spain is a
modern democracy, with Madrid as its bustling capital and around 47 million people.¬†

Known for its warm Mediterranean climate, Spain offers a variety of landscapes, from the beaches of Costa Brava to the mountainous
regions of the Pyrenees. The country is made up of 17 autonomous communities, each with its own regional identity and sometimes
its own language, such as Catalan in Barcelona or Basque in Bilbao. Spain is a popular destination for travelers, known for its
cuisine (like tapas and paella), art (the works of Picasso and Gaud√≠), and lively festivals, such as La Tomatina and Running of
the Bulls.¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†

Spaniards are generally warm and friendly, but interactions tend to be more formal at first, especially in professional or
unfamiliar settings. A handshake is the typical greeting, though close friends or family may exchange two cheek kisses‚Äîone on each
cheek.¬†¬†

Spain‚Äôs mealtimes also differ from American norms, with lunch, the main meal of the day, typically starting around 2 p.m., and
dinner happening later, around 9 or 10 p.m. Socializing over tapas (small dishes) is common before the main meal. Tipping is not
obligatory but rounding up the bill or leaving small change is appreciated, as service charges are usually included in restaurant
bills. Excessive tipping is unnecessary. When in public, Spaniards value discretion and calm; speaking loudly or interrupting
conversations may be seen as rude.¬†¬†¬†

Religion, particularly Catholicism, plays a significant role in Spain‚Äôs cultural and historical traditions. Many Spaniards
identify as Roman Catholic, and this influence is evident in celebrations like Semana Santa (Easter) and Christmas, marked by
elaborate processions and ceremonies. While Spain is a secular state, with religious freedom guaranteed by the constitution, it‚Äôs
still important to show respect when visiting religious sites. Modest dress (covering shoulders and knees) is expected when
entering churches, cathedrals, or monasteries, and visitors should be mindful of quiet and respectful behavior, especially during
services or prayer times.¬†

Finally, be aware of pickpockets in high traffic tourist spots and big cities, like Barcelona or Madrid. Always keep your
belongings on your person and tucked away safely in a secure bag, especially when it‚Äôs nighttime.¬†¬†

South Korea

The basics¬†

South Korea is a land of stark contrasts, a place where tradition and technology are equally embraced, and the quick pace of life
is offset by the serenity of nature.¬†¬†¬†

Korea has a rich and complicated cultural and political history, but since 1948, the country has utilized a presidential system of
government like that of the United States.¬†¬†¬†

Korea uses the Won as its currency. Its economy is highly developed, and the main industries include textile, car, and electronic
manufacturing. However, although Korea is a manufacturing and technological powerhouse, the most valuable Korean export is
arguably its cultural exports of K-pop and teledramas. Bands like BTS and BLACKPINK have a global following and their success,
along with dozens of other K-pop stars, have turned Korea into one of the world‚Äôs most popular tourist destinations for young
people today.¬†¬†¬†

Seoul is a beautiful, clean, and fun city with an endless number of things to do. Check out the bustling attractions of Myeongdong
and Hongdae, do some shopping in Gangnam, and visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace, one of Korea‚Äôs national treasures.¬†¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†

While the language is very different than English, it is a sign of respect to learn some common phrases:¬†

 * An-nyeong ha-se-yo (ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî): Hello¬†

 * An-nyeong-hi ga-se-yo (ÏïàÎÖïÌûà Í∞ÄÏÑ∏Ïöî): Goodbye. [This is the goodbye to use if someone else is leaving.]¬†

 * An-nyeong-hi gye-se-yo (ÏïàÎÖïÌûà Í≥ÑÏÑ∏Ïöî): Goodbye. [This is the goodbye to use when YOU are leaving.¬†¬†

 * Ne (ÎÑ§): Yes¬†¬†

 * A-ni-yo (ÏïÑÎãàÏöî): No¬†¬†

 * Mi-an-hab-ni-da (ÎØ∏ÏïàÌï©ÎãàÎã§): Sorry.¬†¬†

 * Gam-sa-hab-ni-da(Í∞êÏÇ¨Ìï©ÎãàÎã§): Thank you.¬†¬†

The country‚Äôs unique customs and etiquette can seem difficult to navigate but arrive with a respectful attitude and you will be
welcomed by some of the friendliest people in the world. It is important to note many people, especially older people, tend to
keep to themselves. Be sure to read social cues to help determine when to approach someone and when you might not want to.¬†¬†

 * Don‚Äôt tip! Gratuity is included in the bill, and it can feel offensive or confusing if you try to tip on top of that.¬†¬†¬†

 * Be respectful of all statues, religious monuments, and temples.¬†¬†

The transit system in Seoul is efficient but can be confusing to navigate. Be sure to download KakaoMap, Naver maps or Subway
Korea before you arrive.¬†¬†¬†

Korean beauty standards have become a well-known aspect of Korean culture and prioritize a slim figure, v-shaped jaw, pale skin,
straight eyebrows, and large eyes. It is common to see ads featuring fair-skinned models marketing plastic surgery procedures and
products that include whitening agents.¬†¬†

Similar to other parts of Asia, foreigners traveling around Korea may be stared at, pointed to, or called a ‚Äúwayguk,‚Äù which means
‚Äúforeigner.‚Äù Many black and brown travelers experience a version of this ostracization that is influenced by prejudiced notions
about them popularized by western media. However, these travelers often recall these moments as opportunities for cultural
exchange where all parties learn about others‚Äô perspectives and experiences.¬†¬†¬†

Japan

The basics¬†

Japan is an archipelago with four main islands and nearly 4,000 smaller ones, known for its blend of modernity and rich cultural
traditions. Famous worldwide for anime, Japan has also fostered the otaku subculture, including gaming, roleplaying, and
cosplaying.¬†

Public transportation is highly efficient, with metro trains, buses, and taxis serving urban areas, while the bullet train
(shinkansen) is ideal for long-distance travel. Tokyo, Japan's vibrant capital, is the world's most populous city, offering a mix
of traditional and modern cultures. Major districts like Shinjuku, Shibuya, Akihabara, and Harajuku offer unique experiences for
travelers. The climate ranges from snowy winters to hot, humid summers, with Tokyo enjoying a temperate climate similar to
Washington D.C.¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect¬†

In Japan, respect and politeness are central to daily life. Bowing is a traditional greeting, and while tourists aren't expected
to initiate it, returning a bow shows respect. Speaking softly in public spaces is appreciated, as loud or disruptive behavior is
considered rude. Public transportation, especially trains, is highly efficient, but it's important to maintain quiet, which may be
a learning curve for American tourists who are often more outspoken.¬†

Public trash cans are rare, so it‚Äôs common for locals to carry a small plastic bag to hold trash until they can dispose of it.¬†

When visiting temples, shrines, or someone‚Äôs home, remember to remove your shoes. If you're invited into someone's home, it‚Äôs
customary to bring a small gift as a token of appreciation. Tipping is not practiced in Japan and may even be considered rude, as
service is seen as an integral part of the job. Additionally, it's polite to wait for the eldest or host to begin eating before
you start.¬†

Finally, although the language can be challenging for native English speakers, learning a few basic phrases is appreciated. Here
are some useful ones:¬†

 * Hello: Kon‚Äônichiwa¬†

 * Excuse me: Sumimasen¬†

 * Thank you: Arigato¬†

Sweden

The basics¬†

Sweden, the largest country in Scandinavia, is known for its breathtaking natural landscapes, progressive society, and high
quality of life. Stretching from the Arctic Circle in the north to coastal cities in the south, Sweden offers a mix of serene
forests, thousands of lakes, and a long, rugged coastline. Its capital, Stockholm, is built on 14 islands and is famous for its
blend of modern innovation and historic charm. As a leader in sustainability, technology, and social welfare, Sweden is often seen
as a model for balanced development. The country also has a rich cultural heritage, from Viking history to contemporary design and
music.¬†

Cultural norms and what to expect ¬†

Swedish culture values punctuality. Whether you're meeting someone for business or social reasons, it is considered rude to be
late. Be mindful of being on time for scheduled activities, meals and meet-up times. Remember that Stockholm is a cash-free city,
and many cafes, restaurants and hotels actually enforce a no-cash policy. Make sure you‚Äôre prepared with credit cards or digital
pay. Tipping is not as common or obligatory in Sweden as in some other countries, but it is appreciated for good service. In
restaurants, rounding up the bill or leaving a 5-10% tip is common practice. Tipping in cafes or bars is not expected, but leaving
small change is a nice gesture.¬† ¬†

When interacting with locals,¬†know that Swedes have a direct communication style (handshake and eye contact when greeting
someone), which is often seen as refreshing but may seem blunt to those from more indirect cultures. That said, Swedes love to
socialize and engage with each other. For example, Fika is the Swedish coffee and cake ritual that means that the best cafes in
the city will be full to the brim in the afternoons, especially on weekends. The traditional fika is with a cinnamon bun, but some
cafes do their own variations. When interacting, pay attention to personal space. Maintain a little over an arm‚Äôs length of
distance and limit the amount of touching in a conversation.¬†¬†

Sweden is one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly countries in Europe. They have a long history of being on the forefront of legal rights
for the LGBTQ+ community. That said, there are still undercurrents of racism and xenophobia, particularly anti-Black and
Islamophobic racism in Sweden. The far-right Sweden Democrats party, which has roots in WWII-era Nazism, received over 20% of the
votes in an election in October 2022. This wave has challenged conceptions of Sweden as a modern, ‚Äúpost-racial‚Äù society. While
still in the minority, it‚Äôs important to be aware of these biases as they can still be felt in society. ¬†

Here are some helpful key words and common phrases:¬†¬†

 * God morgon = Good morning¬†

 * God kv√§ll! = Good evening¬†

 * Vad heter du? = What is your name?¬†

 * Mitt namn¬†√§ r = My name is¬†

 * Hur m√•r du? = How are you?¬†

 * Pratar du engelska? = Do you speak English?¬†¬†

SOCIAL IDENTITY RESOURCE
