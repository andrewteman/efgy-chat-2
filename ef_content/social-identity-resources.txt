Social Identity Resources
for Student Travelers
Introduction
Travel provides incredible opportunities to learn about yourself, the world, and yourself in the world. But
travel is also a deeply emotional experience that can bring different challenges to every individual based
on the identities they hold and experiences they’ve had.
This resource is intended to help you think about how your intersecting identities can, and will, shape
your experience as an EF student. We encourage you to begin the process of self-reflection by taking some
time to review the reflection questions and follow the links to the pages listed in each section to hear
different perspectives, learn about identity-specific resources, and prepare with helpful tips before you
go abroad.
The guide is organized in sections that focus on various identities and offers reflection questions specific
to a particular identity. This list is by no means exhaustive and there may be multiple identities you relate
to and that influence your view on the world. Not every section in this guide may be part of your identity
but reading it entirely will help you understand others on your program and be better allies for them.
If you have any questions, please contact your EF Advisor.
Gender & Sexuality
As you navigate new and unfamiliar cultures, you may find that attitudes and laws differ from your
experience in the U.S. Prior to your program’s departure date, we recommend researching each of your
destinations, so you know what to expect ahead of your arrival. EF is here to support you in your journey
abroad, and we’ve compiled a few resources below to get you started.

country?
Is there a local LGBTQIA+ community you can connect with, or resources for you while abroad?
What other parts of your identity may intersect with your gender identity or sexual orientation?
How might that impact your travel experience?

Race, Ethnicity, & National Identity
Countries and cultures vary widely in terms of how identities are defined and understood. When preparing
for an experience abroad, it’s important to consider how your race and ethnic identity will be
perceived within in the context of the country you’re traveling to. On average, U.S. students of color
report higher on average adverse incidents while traveling than their white counterparts*; however, some
report that they feel a reprieve from U.S.-based prejudiced while travelling to certain countries. In reality,
every destination is different, and students of color should take time to think through the steps that will
help ensure they are prepared to make the most of their experience.

What are the social dynamics related to race and ethnicity in the U.S.? Research how those are
similar to and different from your host country.
Is there a history of racial or ethnic tension in my host country? Is the issue of immigration a
source of racial or ethnic tension currently?
Are there local communities of people with similar cultural backgrounds to yours that you can
connect with while abroad?
How do you plan to stay connected to your community of support while abroad?
Are you used to being part of the cultural minority at home? If so, how might that impact your
experience in your host country?
Do you hold multiple cultural identities? If so, how might that impact your experience in your host
country/destination?
Consider the availability in your host country of products and services you utilize (e.g., hair care,
skincare, etc.). We recommend researching the availability of products you use and planning in
advance to pack, substitute, or stop using products that won’t be available to purchase.

First-Generation American Travelers
First-generation Americans are among the least likely demographic group to participate in international
education experiences, but they are uniquely positioned to forge connection across cultural barriers. Firstgeneration travelers should also be aware that some travelers who share nationality with the citizens of
the country they are traveling to but were raised elsewhere may be identified as someone who is not
native to the country and may be treated accordingly.

How could your citizenship affect your visa status in your host country?
How can your experience as a first-generation traveler help you forge connections and
relationships with people you meet in the host country?
If you are a person who shares the heritage of your host country but were raised elsewhere, how
might you be perceived while abroad?
How will you introduce the idea of studying abroad or taking a gap year to your family and support
network? What resources are available to you to support your conversation?
What resources or support system are available to you to guide you through the study abroad or

Religion & Spirituality
Before traveling abroad, you might want to take a few minutes to learn more about the religious beliefs
of your host country. Consider researching whether you will be part of a religious majority or minority
abroad, how tolerant your host country may be of various religions, if there are holidays celebrated in
your host country, and if there are places of worship you will be able to visit while traveling. To help you

Dietary Restrictions
If you have strict dietary restrictions that could present a challenge while traveling, here are a few
suggestions:

Plan in advance and communicate your dietary needs to your Gap Advisor, the Tour Directors,
and the group you are traveling with.
When ordering at a restaurant, make sure you ask questions about the way food is prepared—
including everything from the seasonings to the finishing touches.
Find a travel buddy you can trust in the event that someone needs to administer any
medications to you or communicate with local medical staff on your behalf.
Bring an emergency stash of calorie-dense foods that you can eat in case there are unforeseen
situations where the food you are provided does not meet your dietary needs
Other things to do before you travel:
o Create a food translation card that explains your dietary needs
o Connect with your medical provider about getting a medical bracelet explaining your
dietary issues
o Prepare any necessary medications

Reflection Questions: Dietary Restrictions
• How will you express your dietary needs or restrictions in your host country? Consider learning
how to say and write your own allergies or dietary restrictions in the local language.
• Does the country you are traveling to understand your dietary restrictions/requirements? Is the
way to describe your diet different in their local language?

Disability
If you have a physical, mental, and/or learning disability, you may face challenges that differ from ones
you encounter in the US.
Other cultures may have social norms around disabilities that are different from those in the US. This
could lead to a lack of understanding of your disability, which can be exacerbated by language barriers.
You may face stigma around disabilities, particularly regarding mental health care. Outside the US,
internship host companies, accommodations facilities, and modes of transportation are not bound by the
same accessibility laws that apply in the United States, and therefore may not be up to the same standard
of accessibility.
Reflection Questions:
It is important that you communicate your needs and consider alternative ways to meet them as you work
to navigate your new environment. The below questions can help you think through things you may face
during your travels.

Are there any key phrases in the local language that you want to learn to help you explain your
disability or any accommodations you may need?
Is there a local disability advocacy group in the country you’ll be in that you may want to connect
with?
What coping strategies do I use in the U.S. to manage my disability? How will I apply or modify
these while I’m abroad?
What are the country laws regarding any medication I use? Will I be able to obtain a prescription
and/or refills in the country?
